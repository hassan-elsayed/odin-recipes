    <h2>How to Make Fired-Rice step-by-step</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a breif overview of what you can expect when you make a homemade
      Fried-Rice:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your pan before swirling in oil.</li>
      <li>Add uncooked proteins if applicable.</li>
      <li>Add in rice and vegetables.</li>
      <li>Vigorously tossing ingredients for that toasty, golden-brown color that signals big flavor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Assemble ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Place carrots in a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a low boil and cook for 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in peas, then immediately drain in a colander.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Heat a wok over high heat. Pour in vegetable oil, then stir in carrots, peas, and garlic; cook for about 30 seconds. Add eggs; stir quickly to scramble eggs with vegetables.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Stir in cooked rice. Add soy sauce and toss rice to coat. Drizzle with sesame oil and toss again.</p>

    <h3>Cook's Notes:</h3>
    <p>If you don't have any leftover cooked rice, here's how to make it: Combine 4 cups water and 2 cups white rice in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature. For the best fried rice results, cover and refrigerate the rice, 8 hours to overnight, before using in this recipe.</p>
